I am honored to share that our **Randomisation SIG** has been awarded the **SIG of the Year 2025** by the Statisticians in Pharmaceutical Industry (PSI). This recognition highlights our team's efforts in bridging the gap between theoretical randomization and practical implementation in the pharmaceutical industry. Thank you to all members for their continued dedication!
